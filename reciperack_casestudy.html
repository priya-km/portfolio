      <h1>Case Study</h1>
      <hr>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Recipe Rack is a project built using the Python-based Django framework and it has been deployed on Heroku. RR allows its users to view a recipe wiki, upload their own recipes, and search recipes.</p>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>Recipe Rack was built as a personal project for my web development course at CareerFoundry to master my skills of full-stack web development with languages such as Python and its frameworks such as Django.</p>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>Using the Django web framework to develop a fully fledged web application with multiple users and an admin panel.</p>

        <h2>Code & Demo</h2>
        <p>*Please note that when trying out the demo hosted on Heroku, you may not see the images of recipes. This is due to Heroku's ephemeral filesystem, which resets every time the dyno restarts. As a result, uploaded images are not persisted across dyno restarts. I hope to implement an external storage solution in the near future.</p><br>
        <h3>Live Demo Login:</h3>
        <p>Username: demo<br>
        Password: DemoUser</p>
        <p>*Demo users are not authorized to access the Django admin panel and are for user demonstration purposes only.</p>

        <h3>Using Python For The First Time</h3>
        <p>I started by creating a basic version of Recipe Rack using <b>Python</b>, which is a user-friendly programming language. It's like having a neat, organized kitchen where I can easily prepare my recipes. Python allowed me to write simple instructions for the computer to manage recipes.</p>
        <div class="flex-container"style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">

            <div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>For storing these recipes, I used <b>MySQL</b>, similar to a pantry in my digital kitchen. It's a database that keeps all the recipe details neatly organized and easy to retrieve, just like how I'd store ingredients and recipe cards in a real pantry.</p>
                <p>This initial phase involved making a command-line application. Think of it as using basic kitchen tools to get the job done. I could add, view, modify, and search for recipes, all through simple text commands. This step was crucial for me to understand the basics of working with Python and databases before moving on to more advanced stages of my project.</p>

            <div style="margin-right: 20px;">
                <h4>Django Project Set Up</h4>
                <p>After getting comfortable with Python, I introduced <b>Django</b> into the mix. Imagine Django as a state-of-the-art kitchen in a fancy restaurant, equipped with specialized tools and appliances. It's a powerful framework for web development, which means it provides me with ready-made components and structures to build my Recipe Rack website. Just like how a professional kitchen has everything a chef needs to create a variety of dishes efficiently, Django has built-in features that make it easier and faster for me to develop complex web applications.</p>
                <p>Next, let's talk about the <b>virtual environment</b> I set up for this project. Think of a virtual environment like having a personal, mini kitchen inside the larger restaurant kitchen. This mini kitchen is exclusively for preparing a specific dish — in this case, my Recipe Rack project. In technical terms, a virtual environment in Python is a self-contained area on my computer where I can manage the specific tools and ingredients (in this case, software packages and dependencies) needed for my project.</p>
                <p>By using this virtual environment, I make sure that my Recipe Rack project has its own space, separate from other projects that I am working on. This isolation prevents conflicts between different projects, just like avoiding cross-contamination in cooking. I activate this environment when I work on my project and deactivate it when I'm done, much like setting up and cleaning up my personal mini kitchen. This keeps my work organized and ensures that the right tools and ingredients are always at hand for each specific project.</p>

          <h4>Drawing a Database Schema</h4>
              <p> After setting up our virtual kitchen for Reicpe Rack I sketched out a detailed map of where everything should go...this is our 'database schema'. Which included the recipe and user apps. For our digital kitchen, this meant planning out where all the recipe information and user details would be kept in the computer.
              <br> <br> Next, I crafted two main workstations in our digital kitchen: one for recipes and one for users, which in the tech world, we call 'apps'. These are like specialized counters where all the magic happens - one for preparing the dishes (recipes) and the other for managing the cooks (users).</p>

            <div style="margin-right: 20px;">
                <h4>Creating the Apps</h4>
                  <p>After setting up our virtual kitchen for Recipe Rack, I began shaping its essential sections. Running migrations was like making sure all kitchen appliances were installed and functioning - it's about turning our kitchen design into a practical cooking area.<br> 
                  <br>
                  Next came testing the server and seeing, which is similar to doing a trial run in the kitchen, ensuring everything from the stove to the pantry worked smoothly. Finally, creating a superuser account which is the admin. Its as if you were to appoint a head chef, someone with full access and control over the kitchen. <br>

           <h4>Creating the Recipe Model</h4>
            <p>After establishing the database schema for Recipe Rack, which detailed the attributes of the Recipe model, and creating the recipe app, my next step was to bring this model to life within the Recipe app. The Recipe app in Django is like a specialized section in my project, dedicated entirely to handling everything about recipes. Within this app, I defined the Recipe model in the models.py file. Think of the Recipe model as a specific template for each recipe, outlining essential details like the recipe name, ingredients, and cooking time. This model is a crucial part of the app, dictating how recipe information is structured and stored in the database. To integrate this model into the database, I used the 'makemigrations' and 'migrate' commands. 'makemigrations' prepared a detailed plan for incorporating the Recipe model into the database, while 'migrate' executed these plans, updating the database to work seamlessly with this new model. This was a vital step in transforming my initial database design into a dynamic, functional part of Recipe Rack.</p>

              <h4>Running Tests</h4>
                
              <p>Testing in web development is like doing a thorough quality check in a factory before a product is shipped out. It's about making sure that every feature works exactly as intended and that there are no defects. For Recipe Rack, after I set up the Recipe model — our template for what a recipe should include — I wrote tests to verify each part of the model functioned correctly.

              <br> These tests, coded in a tests.py file, are like a series of checks on a recipe card to ensure that every detail, such as the cooking time and recipe name, adheres to specific rules, such as cooking time being only in numbers or the recipe name not exceeding 120 characters. Running these tests is essential as it helps catch any issues early on. It's a bit like proofreading a menu before it's printed. This ensures that users have a smooth experience when they use Recipe Rack, without running into errors or malfunctions that could have been prevented.</p>

            <h4>Adding Recipes via Django Admin Panel</h4>
              <p> Once the framework for Recipe Rack was in place and the tests confirmed everything was working as it should, the next practical step was to start populating it with actual recipes. Let's change the comparisons up now. Think of the Django admin panel as the control room of a television show. Here, I can direct what content goes live. By starting the server — like turning on the power in the control room — I gained access to the admin panel, a powerful interface where I can add, edit, and manage content.

              <br><br> I began by logging into the superuser account that I created earlier on and I entered five recipes into the database. This process is much like filling in a form with details like the recipe title, ingredients, and steps, then saving it. Each saved recipe is like an episode ready to be broadcasted; it's stored in the database and can be retrieved and displayed to any visitor of the Recipe Rack site.</p>

          <div class="desktop-margin-l">
            <h4>Creating the Different Views</h4>
              <p>After filling the Recipe Rack with some delicious recipes using the admin panel, it was time to set up the ways users would interact with the site. I crafted different pages for the website which are called 'views', such as a welcome page that greets users, a page that displays a snapshot and title of each recipe, and a detailed page for when a user wants to see a recipe's full instructions and ingredients. Designing each web page was a fun part for me as I love doing front end designs.
              <br><br>Creating these pages started with writing down the roles each page would play in the recipe app's 'views.py' file, which is like a director outlining scenes in a play. Then, I designed the actual look of each page, like painting a set for each scene, by creating HTML templates. Once the designs were ready, I connected them with their roles in the 'views.py' file, like assigning the painted sets to their respective scenes, ensuring visitors to Recipe Rack would have a visually appealing and smooth experience as they browse through the recipes.</p>

          <div style="margin-right: 20px;">
            <h4>URL Mapping</h4>
              <p>After setting up the pages for Recipe Rack and connecting them to their designs, the next task was to guide users to these pages. Just like street signs help you find the right destination, I needed to create clear directions for the website. This was done by assigning a specific address, known as a URL, to each page.

              <br><br>I did this by writing down these addresses in a 'urls.py' file within the recipe app, which acts like a signpost within a smaller neighborhood. Then, I also updated the 'urls.py' file in the main project folder, which is like the central map at the town hall showing all the neighborhoods and their signposts. This ensured that when users visit Recipe Rack, they can easily navigate to the welcome page, browse through the list of recipes, or dive into the details of a particular recipe by simply following the URLs, just like following an address to a friend's house. After this was done I ran the server again and tested out my new pages via their urls.</p>

            <h4>Login and Logout Features</h4>
            <br>
            <br>
              <p>The next step for Recipe Rack was to create a way for users to sign in and out, just like entering or leaving their own kitchen. I set up a 'login' feature that asks for a username and password, and a 'logout' feature that lets users exit securely. I did skip a direct registration option. This was to avoid the extra complexity and security concerns that come with handling new user sign-ups, such as password management and data protection, keeping the project more straightforward and secure for the time being.

            <br>
              <p class="desktop-margin-l">To make these features easy to use, I added a login button on the home page that takes users to the login page, and once they're signed in, a logout button appears in the navigation bar. This means users can easily access their own space on Recipe Rack to save their favorite recipes or add new ones, and then leave with just a click when they're done. Mapping the URLs was like putting up clear signs pointing to these features, ensuring users always know how to sign in or out.</p>

            <h4>View Protection and Authentication</h4>
              <p>In Recipe Rack, I made sure that only those who are part of the 'kitchen crew' (logged-in users) can see certain pages. The home page, along with the login and logout pages, are like the entrance to a restaurant — open to everyone. However, for more exclusive areas, like where the recipes are stored, I put a digital 'key' on them.
              <br><br>By adding a special code called LoginRequiredMixin to the pages with our recipes, I made them accessible only to users with the key — in other words, those who are logged in. It's like having a security system that ensures only members can enter certain areas of the site, keeping the recipes secure and personalized. This way, Recipe Rack maintains privacy and a sense of exclusivity for its community. If someone tried to access the url for the rlist of recipes without being logged in they would immediately be redirected to the log in page.</p>

            <h4>Adding a Search Feature and Charts</h4>
              <p>
                I enhanced Recipe Rack by adding a feature that lets users search for recipes based on how hard they are to make, like sorting a cookbook by beginner, intermediate, or advanced dishes. Once a user picks a difficulty level, they can also choose to see the results in different visual forms: a pie chart, a bar chart, or a line chart. It's like choosing between seeing a photo, a graph, or a list — each one shows the same information in a unique way.
                <br>
                <br>
                Creating this feature involved a few technical steps: setting up a form for users to enter their search, finding the matching recipes, and then using tools to turn those results into charts. While the charts might not have been as pretty as the rest of the site, they were a great way for me to learn and apply data analysis and visualization directly within the project. It gave users a fun and interactive way to explore recipes and see the distribution of different difficulty levels at a glance.</p>

          <h4>Final Steps - Hosting on Heroku</h4>
            <p>
              In the final phase of the Recipe Rack project, my focus shifted to refining the website's design. I enhanced the visual aspects by applying CSS, making the interface more user-friendly and visually appealing. This step was about ensuring that the website not only worked well but also looked great. Additionally, I expanded the website's content by adding many more recipes and enabling a feature for users to contribute their own. Following this was additional testing before I movwed on to hosting the project live.

            <br><br>To make Recipe Rack accessible to everyone, I hosted the website on Heroku, a platform that allows web projects to be available on the internet. This meant that Recipe Rack was not just a local project anymore; it was now live and could be visited by anyone online. You can explore the full functionality and appearance of Recipe Rack by watching the demo video or by logging in to the website using the provided demo account credentials, both mentioned below.</p>
              <br>
              <p>*Please note that when trying out the demo hosted on Heroku, you may not see the images of recipes. This is due to Heroku's ephemeral filesystem, which resets every time the dyno restarts. As a result, uploaded images are not persisted across dyno restarts. I hope to implement an external storage solution in the near future.</p><br>

    <!-- CHALLENGES -->
   <div class="challenges">
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>This project was my first time working with Python and Django, and it was quite a learning experience. I found their rules and structure pretty straightforward to understand. However, I ran into some challenges because some of the learning materials were a bit out of date, which is common in the fast-moving world of technology. This sometimes made my code not work right, but I managed to fix these issues by looking up solutions on websites like Stack Overflow, where there's a big community of web developers ready to help.</p>
      <p>One thing I'm looking to improve in the future is how the website handles pictures, especially for the recipes. I plan to use a tool like Firebase for this, so that the pictures show up properly on the demo site. I'm excited to work on this in the future and make the website even better.</p>
