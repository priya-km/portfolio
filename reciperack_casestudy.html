      <h1>Case Study</h1>
      <hr>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Recipe Rack is a project built using the Python-based Django framework and it has been deployed on Heroku. RR allows its users to view a recipe wiki, upload their own recipes, and search recipes.</p>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>Recipe Rack was built as a personal project for my web development course at CareerFoundry to master my skills of full-stack web development with languages such as Python and its frameworks such as Django.</p>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>Using the Django web framework to develop a fully fledged web application with multiple users and an admin panel.</p>

        <h2>Code & Demo</h2>
        <p>*Please note that when trying out the demo hosted on Heroku, you may not see the images of recipes. This is due to Heroku's ephemeral filesystem, which resets every time the dyno restarts. As a result, uploaded images are not persisted across dyno restarts. I hope to implement an external storage solution in the near future.</p><br>
        <h3>Live Demo Login:</h3>
        <p>Username: demo<br>
        Password: DemoUser</p>
        <p>*Demo users are not authorized to access the Django admin panel and are for user demonstration purposes only.</p>

        <!-- PYTHON -->
        <h3>Using Python For The First Time</h3>
        <p>I started by creating a basic version of Recipe Rack using <b>Python</b>, which is a user-friendly programming language. It's like having a neat, organized kitchen where I can easily prepare my recipes. Python allowed me to write simple instructions for the computer to manage recipes.</p>
        <div class="flex-container"style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">
            <a href="img/case_studies/recipe_rack/rr_achv1.png" target="_blank">
                <img src="img/case_studies/recipe_rack/rr_achv1.png" alt="Command Line Recipe Rack" width="400" height="220" style="margin-right: 20px;">

            <div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>For storing these recipes, I used <b>MySQL</b>, similar to a pantry in my digital kitchen. It's a database that keeps all the recipe details neatly organized and easy to retrieve, just like how I'd store ingredients and recipe cards in a real pantry.</p>
                <p>This initial phase involved making a command-line application. Think of it as using basic kitchen tools to get the job done. I could add, view, modify, and search for recipes, all through simple text commands. This step was crucial for me to understand the basics of working with Python and databases before moving on to more advanced stages of my project.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="flex-container" style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">
            <div style="margin-right: 20px;">
                <h4>Django Project Set Up</h4>
                <p>After getting comfortable with Python, I introduced <b>Django</b> into the mix. Imagine Django as a state-of-the-art kitchen in a fancy restaurant, equipped with specialized tools and appliances. It's a powerful framework for web development, which means it provides me with ready-made components and structures to build my Recipe Rack website. Just like how a professional kitchen has everything a chef needs to create a variety of dishes efficiently, Django has built-in features that make it easier and faster for me to develop complex web applications.</p>
                <p>Next, let's talk about the <b>virtual environment</b> I set up for this project. Think of a virtual environment like having a personal, mini kitchen inside the larger restaurant kitchen. This mini kitchen is exclusively for preparing a specific dish — in this case, my Recipe Rack project. In technical terms, a virtual environment in Python is a self-contained area on my computer where I can manage the specific tools and ingredients (in this case, software packages and dependencies) needed for my project.</p>
                <p>By using this virtual environment, I make sure that my Recipe Rack project has its own space, separate from other projects that I am working on. This isolation prevents conflicts between different projects, just like avoiding cross-contamination in cooking. I activate this environment when I work on my project and deactivate it when I'm done, much like setting up and cleaning up my personal mini kitchen. This keeps my work organized and ensures that the right tools and ingredients are always at hand for each specific project.</p>

          </a>
         <div> 
          <h4>Running Migrations</h4>
          <p>After setting up our virtual kitchen for Recipe Rack, I began shaping its essential sections. Creating the user and recipe models was like organizing the kitchen workspace and recipe shelves. Then, running migrations was like making sure all kitchen appliances were installed and functioning - it's about turning our kitchen design into a practical cooking area.<br> 
           <br>
            Next came testing the server, which is similar to doing a trial run in the kitchen, ensuring everything from the stove to the pantry worked smoothly. Finally, creating a superuser account which is the admin. Its as if you were to appoint a head chef, someone with full access and control over the kitchen. <br>

        <div class="flex-container" style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">
            <div style="margin-right: 20px;">
                <h4>Drawing a database schema - ALL CONTENT BELOW IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION</h4>
                <p>Drew the schema, made models based on the schema/attributes/etc. Made migrations again. After choosing MongoDB for the database, the next step was to create 'models' for Users and Movies in the myFlix app. Think of these models as blueprints or templates.<br><br>
                The <b>User model</b> is like a blueprint for all the information we want to store about each user, like their name, email, and preferences. It helps the app understand what user information looks like and how to organize it.<br><br>
                Similarly, the <b>Movie model</b> is a blueprint for all the details we want to keep about each movie, such as the title, director, genre, and release date. This model helps the app categorize and manage the vast movie information efficiently.<br><br>
                By defining these models, I essentially set up a structured way for the myFlix app to handle and store information. It's like organizing files into well-labeled folders, making it easier to find and use them later. This organization is crucial for the app to function smoothly and provide a great experience for movie enthusiasts.<br><br>
                Interestingly, this phase of the project often found me accompanied by my dog, Rosie, who would sit next to my laptop as I worked on the 'models.js' file and others. Her presence added a sense of calm and companionship to the hours spent coding and organizing data for myFlix.</p>

         <div> 
           <h4>Running Tests</h4>
            <p>In the next phase of developing myFlix, I used a tool called Postman to test the endpoints I had created.<br> <br>Think of Postman like a rehearsal for a play, where I check each part of the app to make sure it works as expected, much like actors rehearsing their lines. This step is crucial to ensure that when users interact with the app, it responds correctly and smoothly. <br><br>Additionally, I focused on implementing user security through two files: <b>auth.js and passport.js</b>. This was done with HTTP authentication and JWT tokens. These files are like the security guards of the app.</p>
        </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="flex-container" style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">
            <div style="margin-right: 20px;">
              <p>The <b>auth.js</b> file is responsible for 'authentication,' which is like checking a guest's invitation at a party. It confirms users are who they say they are when they log in.<br><br>
              The <b>passport.js</b> file handles 'authorization,' which is like giving guests a pass to access different areas of the party based on their roles. This ensures that users only access information and features they are allowed to, maintaining privacy and security in the app. This combination of authentication and authorization is essential to protect both the users and the information within myFlix.</p>

            <div>
                <h4>Running The Server</h4>
                <p>The final step in creating the back end of myFlix was to host the API. This means finding a place on the internet where the app's data and functions live, so they can be accessed from anywhere. It's like choosing a physical location for a store where people can visit. Initially, I used a service called <b>Render</b>, which is like a free space to set up shop. However, I noticed that Render was quite slow, meaning it took a long time for users to access information from myFlix, similar to a customer waiting too long in line at a store.
                <br> <br>Realizing that this slow speed might frustrate users, I decided to switch to a different hosting service called <b>Heroku</b> shortly after beginning the front-end development. Heroku is another platform that provides space on the internet, but it's known for being faster and more reliable. This switch was like moving the store to a better location with quicker service, ensuring that users of myFlix could get the information they want promptly and efficiently. Making this change was important before moving on to developing the client side of the project</p>

            <h4>Creating Views and Templates</h4>
              <p>The first step in building the front-end client of myFlix was setting up React. React is like a collection of building blocks for creating the app's user interface, which is the part users interact with. It allows assembling these blocks - such as buttons, menus, and information sections - into a user-friendly and interactive layout.
                <br><br>Next, I configured Parcel, which acts as an efficient assistant in the development process. Parcel handles the organization and preparation of the app's code and resources. It simplifies tasks like combining code files and optimizing images, ensuring the app loads quickly and runs smoothly. This setup enables me to focus more on enhancing the user experience of myFlix.</p>

          <div>
            <h4>Developing the Pages</h4>
              <p>In the next stage of building myFlix, I focused on creating React components, which are like individual building blocks of the app's interface. For example, I developed the 'MainView' component, which acts as the central page where users can browse movies, much like the main display area in a store.
              <br><br> Additionally, I made the 'MovieCard' component, a smaller block that represents each movie. It's like a small product label, showing key details of each movie at a glance. These components helped shape the basic structure of myFlix, as seen in the screenshot.</p>

            <h4>Login and Logout Features</h4>
              <p>After assembling the main components of myFlix, I moved on to creating React forms for different user interactions. React forms are essentially digital forms on the app, similar to filling out a form on paper. They're used for entering and submitting information. I created forms for different purposes: a 'Login' form, a 'Sign Up' form, and a 'Profile' view form.</p>

              <p>The 'Login' form is where existing users enter their details to access their accounts, just like using a key to open a locked door. The 'Sign Up' form is used by new users to create an account, similar to filling out a registration form for a new club or service. Lastly, the 'Profile' view allows users to view and edit their personal information, akin to looking at and updating a personal ID card. These forms are essential for user interaction within myFlix, allowing users to easily sign in, join, and manage their profiles.</p>

            <h4>View Protection and Authentication</h4>
              <p>After setting up the basic functions and forms in myFlix, the next step was to enhance the app's design and layout using something called React Bootstrap. React Bootstrap is a collection of ready-made design elements and tools that help in making the app not only look good but also work well on different devices, like phones, tablets, and computers.
              <br><br>One of the key features I used from React Bootstrap is its 'responsive grid.' This grid system allows the layout of the app to adjust automatically based on the size of the screen it's being viewed on. For example, on the myFlix main view page, where all the movies are listed, this grid system arranges the movie information neatly, whether you're looking at it on a small phone screen or a large computer monitor. It's like a bookshelf that magically resizes to fit in different rooms, always keeping the books (in this case, movie information) organized and easy to view. This step was crucial in ensuring that myFlix looks great and is user-friendly on any device.</p>

            <h4>Adding a Search Feature and Charts</h4>
              <p>After enhancing the design of myFlix, I moved on to configuring the routing. This means setting up a system that guides users from one page to another within the app, similar to a navigation system in a building. It allows users to smoothly move between different sections, like the main movie list, individual movie details, and their profile, without any hassle. This step was vital to create a seamless and intuitive experience for users as they explore various parts of myFlix.</p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>This project was one of my favorites, even though it had its challenges. When building the server, I ran into a small problem because I used an older way of writing code with Mongoose. But, with help from my mentor, Paulo, I used console.log statements to figure out and fix the problem quickly.</p>
      <p>On the client side, where I worked with React, it took me some time to get things just right. For instance, making the 'favorite movies' feature work correctly was a bit tricky. I had to double-check how I was connecting to my API and make sure everything was set up right to show up properly on the user profiles. This experience really helped me get better with React.</p>
      <p>Next, I plan to improve the profile page. I want it to show information about the user. This will make the page more personal and informative, which means tweaking how the page looks and how it connects to the back-end to display user details better.</p>
