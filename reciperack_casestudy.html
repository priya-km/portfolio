      <h1>Case Study</h1>
      <hr>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Recipe Rack is a project built using the Python-based Django framework and it has been deployed on Heroku. RR allows its users to view a recipe wiki, upload their own recipes, and search recipes.</p>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>Recipe Rack was built as a personal project for my web development course at CareerFoundry to master my skills of full-stack web development with languages such as Python and its frameworks such as Django.</p>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>Using the Django web framework to develop a fully fledged web application with multiple users and an admin panel.</p>

        <h2>Code & Demo</h2>
        <p>*Please note that when trying out the demo hosted on Heroku, you may not see the images of recipes. This is due to Heroku's ephemeral filesystem, which resets every time the dyno restarts. As a result, uploaded images are not persisted across dyno restarts. I hope to implement an external storage solution in the near future.</p><br>
        <h3>Live Demo Login:</h3>
        <p>Username: demo<br>
        Password: DemoUser</p>
        <p>*Demo users are not authorized to access the Django admin panel and are for user demonstration purposes only.</p>

        <!-- PYTHON -->
        <h3>Using Python For The First Time</h3>
        <p>I started by creating a basic version of Recipe Rack using <b>Python</b>, which is a user-friendly programming language. It's like having a neat, organized kitchen where I can easily prepare my recipes. Python allowed me to write simple instructions for the computer to manage recipes.</p>
        <div class="flex-container"style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">
            <a href="img/case_studies/recipe_rack/rr_achv1.png" target="_blank">
                <img src="img/case_studies/recipe_rack/rr_achv1.png" alt="Command Line Recipe Rack" width="400" height="220" style="margin-right: 20px;">

            <div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>For storing these recipes, I used <b>MySQL</b>, similar to a pantry in my digital kitchen. It's a database that keeps all the recipe details neatly organized and easy to retrieve, just like how I'd store ingredients and recipe cards in a real pantry.</p>
                <p>This initial phase involved making a command-line application. Think of it as using basic kitchen tools to get the job done. I could add, view, modify, and search for recipes, all through simple text commands. This step was crucial for me to understand the basics of working with Python and databases before moving on to more advanced stages of my project.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="flex-container" style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">
            <div style="margin-right: 20px;">
                <h4>Django Project Set Up</h4>
                <p>After getting comfortable with Python, I introduced <b>Django</b> into the mix. Imagine Django as a state-of-the-art kitchen in a fancy restaurant, equipped with specialized tools and appliances. It's a powerful framework for web development, which means it provides me with ready-made components and structures to build my Recipe Rack website. Just like how a professional kitchen has everything a chef needs to create a variety of dishes efficiently, Django has built-in features that make it easier and faster for me to develop complex web applications.</p>
                <p>Next, let's talk about the <b>virtual environment</b> I set up for this project. Think of a virtual environment like having a personal, mini kitchen inside the larger restaurant kitchen. This mini kitchen is exclusively for preparing a specific dish — in this case, my Recipe Rack project. In technical terms, a virtual environment in Python is a self-contained area on my computer where I can manage the specific tools and ingredients (in this case, software packages and dependencies) needed for my project.</p>
                <p>By using this virtual environment, I make sure that my Recipe Rack project has its own space, separate from other projects that I am working on. This isolation prevents conflicts between different projects, just like avoiding cross-contamination in cooking. I activate this environment when I work on my project and deactivate it when I'm done, much like setting up and cleaning up my personal mini kitchen. This keeps my work organized and ensures that the right tools and ingredients are always at hand for each specific project.</p>

         <div> 
          <h4>Drawing a Database Schema</h4>
              <p> After setting up our virtual kitchen for Reicpe Rack I sketched out a detailed map of where everything should go...this is our 'database schema'. Which included the recipe and user apps. For our digital kitchen, this meant planning out where all the recipe information and user details would be kept in the computer.
              <br> <br> Next, I crafted two main workstations in our digital kitchen: one for recipes and one for users, which in the tech world, we call 'apps'. These are like specialized counters where all the magic happens - one for preparing the dishes (recipes) and the other for managing the cooks (users).</p>
        </div>
        </div>

        <div class="flex-container" style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">
            <div style="margin-right: 20px;">
                <h4>Creating the Apps</h4>
                  <p>After setting up our virtual kitchen for Recipe Rack, I began shaping its essential sections. Running migrations was like making sure all kitchen appliances were installed and functioning - it's about turning our kitchen design into a practical cooking area.<br> 
                  <br>
                  Next came testing the server and seeing, which is similar to doing a trial run in the kitchen, ensuring everything from the stove to the pantry worked smoothly. Finally, creating a superuser account which is the admin. Its as if you were to appoint a head chef, someone with full access and control over the kitchen. <br>

         <div> 
           <h4>Creating the Recipe Model</h4>
            <p>After establishing the database schema for Recipe Rack, which detailed the attributes of the Recipe model, and creating the recipe app, my next step was to bring this model to life within the Recipe app. The Recipe app in Django is like a specialized section in my project, dedicated entirely to handling everything about recipes. Within this app, I defined the Recipe model in the models.py file. Think of the Recipe model as a specific template for each recipe, outlining essential details like the recipe name, ingredients, and cooking time. This model is a crucial part of the app, dictating how recipe information is structured and stored in the database. To integrate this model into the database, I used the 'makemigrations' and 'migrate' commands. 'makemigrations' prepared a detailed plan for incorporating the Recipe model into the database, while 'migrate' executed these plans, updating the database to work seamlessly with this new model. This was a vital step in transforming my initial database design into a dynamic, functional part of Recipe Rack.</p>

            <div>
              <h4>Running Tests</h4>
                
              <p>Testing in web development is like doing a thorough quality check in a factory before a product is shipped out. It's about making sure that every feature works exactly as intended and that there are no defects. For Recipe Rack, after I set up the Recipe model — our template for what a recipe should include — I wrote tests to verify each part of the model functioned correctly.

              <br> These tests, coded in a tests.py file, are like a series of checks on a recipe card to ensure that every detail, such as the cooking time and recipe name, adheres to specific rules, such as cooking time being only in numbers or the recipe name not exceeding 120 characters. Running these tests is essential as it helps catch any issues early on. It's a bit like proofreading a menu before it's printed. This ensures that users have a smooth experience when they use Recipe Rack, without running into errors or malfunctions that could have been prevented.</p>

            <h4>Adding Recipes via Django Admin Panel</h4>
              <p> Once the framework for Recipe Rack was in place and the tests confirmed everything was working as it should, the next practical step was to start populating it with actual recipes. Let's change the comparisons up now. Think of the Django admin panel as the control room of a television show. Here, I can direct what content goes live. By starting the server — like turning on the power in the control room — I gained access to the admin panel, a powerful interface where I can add, edit, and manage content.

              <br><br> I began by logging into the superuser account that I created earlier on and I entered five recipes into the database. This process is much like filling in a form with details like the recipe title, ingredients, and steps, then saving it. Each saved recipe is like an episode ready to be broadcasted; it's stored in the database and can be retrieved and displayed to any visitor of the Recipe Rack site.</p>

            <h4>Creating the Different Views - ALL CONTENT BELOW IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION</h4>
              <p>In the next stage of building myFlix, I focused on creating React components, which are like individual building blocks of the app's interface. For example, I developed the 'MainView' component, which acts as the central page where users can browse movies, much like the main display area in a store.
              <br><br> Additionally, I made the 'MovieCard' component, a smaller block that represents each movie. It's like a small product label, showing key details of each movie at a glance. These components helped shape the basic structure of myFlix, as seen in the screenshot.</p>

            <h4>Login and Logout Features</h4> <!-- and views -->
              <p>After assembling the main components of myFlix, I moved on to creating React forms for different user interactions. React forms are essentially digital forms on the app, similar to filling out a form on paper. They're used for entering and submitting information. I created forms for different purposes: a 'Login' form, a 'Sign Up' form, and a 'Profile' view form.</p>

              <p>The 'Login' form is where existing users enter their details to access their accounts, just like using a key to open a locked door. The 'Sign Up' form is used by new users to create an account, similar to filling out a registration form for a new club or service. Lastly, the 'Profile' view allows users to view and edit their personal information, akin to looking at and updating a personal ID card. These forms are essential for user interaction within myFlix, allowing users to easily sign in, join, and manage their profiles.</p>

              <p>After setting up the basic functions and forms in myFlix, the next step was to enhance the app's design and layout using something called React Bootstrap. React Bootstrap is a collection of ready-made design elements and tools that help in making the app not only look good but also work well on different devices, like phones, tablets, and computers.
              <br><br>One of the key features I used from React Bootstrap is its 'responsive grid.' This grid system allows the layout of the app to adjust automatically based on the size of the screen it's being viewed on. For example, on the myFlix main view page, where all the movies are listed, this grid system arranges the movie information neatly, whether you're looking at it on a small phone screen or a large computer monitor. It's like a bookshelf that magically resizes to fit in different rooms, always keeping the books (in this case, movie information) organized and easy to view. This step was crucial in ensuring that myFlix looks great and is user-friendly on any device.</p>

            <h4>Adding a Search Feature and Charts</h4>
              <p>After enhancing the design of myFlix, I moved on to configuring the routing. This means setting up a system that guides users from one page to another within the app, similar to a navigation system in a building. It allows users to smoothly move between different sections, like the main movie list, individual movie details, and their profile, without any hassle. This step was vital to create a seamless and intuitive experience for users as they explore various parts of myFlix.</p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>This project was one of my favorites, even though it had its challenges. When building the server, I ran into a small problem because I used an older way of writing code with Mongoose. But, with help from my mentor, Paulo, I used console.log statements to figure out and fix the problem quickly.</p>
      <p>On the client side, where I worked with React, it took me some time to get things just right. For instance, making the 'favorite movies' feature work correctly was a bit tricky. I had to double-check how I was connecting to my API and make sure everything was set up right to show up properly on the user profiles. This experience really helped me get better with React.</p>
      <p>Next, I plan to improve the profile page. I want it to show information about the user. This will make the page more personal and informative, which means tweaking how the page looks and how it connects to the back-end to display user details better.</p>
